# MuscleHub A/B test
Analysis of A/B test results for an imaginary gym. SQL database was provided by Codecademy. Performed table transformation with SQL and Pandas, tested significance with SciPy, visualized data with Matplotlib and Plotly. The analysis determined that the canceling fitness test increases membership purchases. Chose to increase the significance level to insure the gym does not keep the test that decreases purchases or cancels the test that increases them. Recommended running more A/B test before canceling fitness test.
