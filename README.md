# Codecademy Off-Platform Projects
This repository holds my solutions for Codecademy capstone projects on data analysis and data visualization: from bar and violin charts to significance and A/B tests and stock market analysis.  
Here is an overview of projects and task descriptions as they were written on Codecademy:

## Data Visualization Capstone Projects

### 1. Visualizing Kiva Data With Seaborn

In this project, you will be visualizing and looking for insights in a dataset from Kaggle, that contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva.
Using Seaborn, you will explore the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts, and visualize the distribution of loan amount by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.

### 2. Netflix Stock Profile Visualization

You’ve been hired as a data visualization developer at Yahoo Finance! Your job is to help financial analysts by creating some of the visualizations for a stock profile of Netflix.
In finance, a stock profile is a series of studies, visualizations, and analyses that dive into different aspects a publicly traded company’s data.
During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data. Your visualizations will help the financial analysts asses the risk of the Netflix stock.

For the purposes of the project, you will only visualize data for the year of 2017. Specifically, you will be in charge of creating the following visualizations:
- The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
- Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
- The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
- A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017 

### 3. Life Expectancy and GDP Visualization

For this project, you will act as a data researcher for the World Health Organization. You will be helping them analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.
During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data.

## Data Analysis Capstone Projects

### 4. Biodiversity in National Parks Data Analysis

For this project, you’ll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service. You’ll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.
The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

### 5. MuscleHub A/B Test

You’ve been hired to help MuscleHub, a fancy gym, run an A/B test!
Currently, when a visitor to MuscleHub is considering buying a membership, he or she follows the following steps:
- Take a fitness test with a personal trainer
- Fill out an application for the gym
- Send in their payment for their first month’s membership
Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.
Visitors will randomly be assigned to one of two groups:
- Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer
- Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application
Janet’s hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub.

## Financial Data Analysis Projects

### 6. Real Estate Investment Trust Analysis
In this project, you will analyze Real Estate Investment Trusts, commonly known as REITs. REITs are companies that own or operate real estate that produces income. REITs, like the stocks of regular public companies, are traded on different stock exchanges. Investing in a REIT allows you to invest in portfolios of real estate assets the same way you can invest in a company by buying its stock.
Using financial statistics and NumPy you will analyze two REITs: Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA), which invests in healthcare real estate, and Equity Residential (NASDAQ:EQR), which invests in rental apartment properties.

### 7. Visualizing Tech Stocks
In this project you will analyze and visualize the top 5 highest valued technology stocks, as of the end of the first half of 2019: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Using Pandas, Pandas-Datarader, and Matplotlib, you will take a visual look into the similarities and differences between these stocks during the six month period from January through June 2019. In your analysis you will perform the following:
- Visualize the stock prices using matplotlib
- Calculate and visualize the daily simple rate of return 
- Calculate and visualize the mean rates of return
- Calculate and visualize the variances of the returns
- Calculate and visualize the standard deviations of the returns
- Write a short thesis based on the correlations between the tech stocks
