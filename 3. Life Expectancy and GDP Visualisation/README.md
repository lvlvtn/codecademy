# Life Expectancy and GDP Visualisation

This project aims to visualize and analyze the relationship between the economic output of the country and the life expectancy of its citizens for six nations on various stages of development. The project utilizes Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The exploratory analysis will be based on descriptive statistics and various visualizations: histogram, bar, violin, scatter, and line plots.

Research Questions:
- What is the distribution of the life expectancy and GDP in the six nations?
- Has life expectancy increased over times?
- Has GDP increased over time?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- How can we explain the relationship?
